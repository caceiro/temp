# Customer Data Platform (CDP) Implementation – Product Scoping Document (P2P Money Transfer App)

## Context
**Business Problem:** Our P2P money transfer app is facing fragmented customer data spread across multiple systems (app analytics, transaction databases, marketing tools, etc.). This siloed data makes it difficult to gain a holistic view of users, leading to inconsistent customer experiences and suboptimal decision-making. Marketing campaigns are broad and untargeted due to incomplete customer insights, and product teams lack the data context to personalize in-app features. As a result, we see lower engagement and retention than potential, and marketing spend is less efficient because we cannot precisely segment and target users.

**Hypothesis (CDP Solution):** Implementing a Customer Data Platform will unify disparate data into a single customer view, enabling **360-degree profiles** for each user ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=A%20CDP%20also%20helps%20marketers,personalized%20down%20to%20an%20individual)). By consolidating transactional, behavioral, and demographic data, a CDP can eliminate data silos and provide a *“single source of truth”* for each customer ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=A%20CDP%20also%20helps%20marketers,personalized%20down%20to%20an%20individual)). We expect this unified platform to unlock **precise segmentation and personalization** – delivering more relevant messages and features to users – which in turn should improve user engagement, loyalty, and conversion. For example, a CDP would allow marketing to target users with personalized offers at the right moments, rather than one-size-fits-all blasts. This relevance drives better ROI (personalization can **increase marketing spend efficiency by 10–30%** according to industry research ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=Personalization%20can%20reduce%20acquisition%20costs,30))) and a smoother user experience that differentiates us in a competitive fintech market.

**Existing Pain Points:** Key pain points that the CDP will address include: 

- **Data Fragmentation:** User data is currently siloed in different platforms (e.g. BigQuery for data warehousing, Amplitude for product analytics, MoEngage for engagement). These silos prevent teams from seeing the full customer journey. Incomplete customer data makes effective segmentation and personalization nearly impossible ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=Connected%20consumers%20expect%20a%20unified%2C,experience%2C%20you%20need%20unified%20data)). We lack an integrated vantage point on customer behavior, leading to missed opportunities and wasted resources in outreach efforts.
- **Limited Personalization:** Because data isn’t unified, our communications and in-app experiences are mostly generic. We cannot easily tailor content or features to individual user’s behavior or preferences. This “one-size-fits-all” approach diminishes user engagement and loyalty. A CDP can link all customer touchpoints and **build rich profiles** (e.g. linking a user’s transaction history with their app usage patterns) to enable true one-to-one personalization ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=A%20CDP%20also%20helps%20marketers,personalized%20down%20to%20an%20individual)).
- **Marketing Inefficiency:** Our marketing team spends a lot on broad campaigns with uncertain impact. Data silos make it hard to analyze campaign performance across channels or to retarget users intelligently. We suspect we are overspending to reach the wrong audiences due to lack of refined segments. By unifying data and enabling smarter audience builds, a CDP will let us focus marketing spend on high-propensity users and measure results more accurately. This should reduce customer acquisition cost and improve conversion rates, as **relevant, data-driven campaigns** perform much better than generic ones ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=Sending%20generic%20campaigns%20to%20a,the%20intensely%20competitive%20retail%20space)). In short, the CDP will help turn data into actionable insights, improving both user experience and business KPIs.

## Solution Ideation
We explored multiple approaches to implementing a CDP, iterating through **Ideation**, **Evaluation**, and **Refinement** phases to arrive at the best solution for our business and technical needs.

### Ideation 
In the ideation phase, we considered both **off-the-shelf** and **custom-built** CDP solutions, including hybrid approaches:
- **Off-the-Shelf CDP:** Adopting a third-party CDP platform (such as Segment, mParticle, or Tealium) that provides a ready-made solution. These packaged CDPs offer pre-built integrations and user-friendly interfaces for marketing ([The 2024 Customer Data Platform: What Marketers (Actually) Need to Know about CDPs](https://zetaglobal.com/resource-center/customer-data-platform-cdp/#:~:text=Packaged%20CDPs%3A%20Turn)). They promise quick deployment and proven capabilities like identity resolution and audience management without heavy in-house development. We noted that off-the-shelf tools are often geared towards marketing users and come with a wide range of connectors for common systems.
- **Custom-Built CDP:** Building our own CDP using our existing data infrastructure (leveraging our Google BigQuery warehouse, custom pipelines, etc.). A **composable** in-house solution could be tailored to our exact needs – we would design microservices for data collection, profile unification, and activation. This approach offers maximum flexibility and full control over data (important for compliance), but requires significant engineering effort. We also considered open-source CDP components (like RudderStack or Snowplow) as building blocks to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- **Hybrid (Composable) Approach:** Combining the best of both – for example, using our data warehouse as the **foundation** while integrating a lightweight CDP service for specific functions (such as identity resolution or real-time audience activation). This “modular CDP” approach aims to leverage our current stack (BigQuery, etc.) and avoid data duplication, while still providing a marketer-friendly interface and real-time capabilities ([The 2024 Customer Data Platform: What Marketers (Actually) Need to Know about CDPs](https://zetaglobal.com/resource-center/customer-data-platform-cdp/#:~:text=Modular%20CDPs%3A%20A%20hybrid%20approach)). It could involve using a **warehouse-native CDP** tool that runs directly on BigQuery or using reverse ETL (tools like Hightouch) to activate warehouse data in external platforms.

### Evaluation 
In evaluating these options, we assessed each approach against key factors: **integration complexity, compliance, scalability, and cost**:
- **Integration Complexity:** How easily can the solution integrate with our current systems (BigQuery, Amplitude, MoEngage, membership DB, payment services, etc.)? Off-the-shelf CDPs advertise many integrations, but we must ensure they align with our specific stack (e.g. a connector to BigQuery or export to our email tool) and can handle custom data models. Integration is a major challenge – 36% of marketers cite connecting disparate systems as a top hurdle ([Top 6 Criteria to Evaluate CDP Integrations - ActionIQ](https://www.actioniq.com/blog/cdp-integrations/#:~:text=As%20noted%20by%20an%20Ascend,this%20as%20a%20major%20challenge)). A custom solution offers native integration with our databases and APIs by design, but we must build and maintain those pipelines (data mapping, transformation, and testing for each integration) ([Top 6 Criteria to Evaluate CDP Integrations - ActionIQ](https://www.actioniq.com/blog/cdp-integrations/#:~:text=,and%20security%20and%20data%20governance)). We weighed whether the convenience of pre-built connectors outweighs the effort of custom development. Quality of integration is key – any solution must ensure data flows accurately and in sync across systems to avoid inconsistencies.
- **Compliance & Security:** As a financial app, data privacy and regulatory compliance are non-negotiable. We evaluated whether a vendor CDP could meet GDPR and financial data regulations. An external SaaS CDP would require sending customer data to a third-party cloud – we examined their security certifications (encryption, access controls, ISO/SOC2 compliance, etc.) and whether data can be siloed per region (for GDPR data residency). A custom solution would keep data in-house (or on our approved cloud infrastructure) giving us more direct control over compliance (e.g. we can ensure **encryption and access control** are implemented to our standards ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=,collection%20and%20usage%2C%20including%20providing)) ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=,based%20segments%20for%20suppression))). We also considered **consent management** – any solution must accommodate user consent preferences and data deletion requests. Vendor solutions often have built-in privacy features, whereas a custom build means implementing these from scratch. On balance, if a third-party CDP could not guarantee our compliance requirements or introduces privacy risk, that would be a significant drawback.
- **Scalability:** We need a CDP that can scale with our growing user base and data volume. Our app generates millions of events (transactions, clicks, etc.), so the solution must handle both **real-time event streams and large batch data** without performance degradation. Packaged CDPs are typically multi-tenant platforms built to handle high volumes (and we would verify capacity with the vendor). A custom solution would be designed on cloud infrastructure (e.g. GCP) that can scale, but we must architect it correctly (sharding, streaming infrastructure) to handle peak loads. We evaluated each option’s track record: for instance, vendor SLAs for throughput, or our internal team’s ability to build a pipeline for, say, 100k events/second. Scalability also includes future features – the platform should scale not just in volume, but in capability (e.g. adding new data sources easily, supporting more complex analytics). This factor tied closely to **technical feasibility** for each approach.
- **Cost:** We analyzed the total cost of ownership for each approach, including both **initial implementation and ongoing costs**. Off-the-shelf CDPs usually have licensing or usage-based fees (often tied to MTUs – monthly tracked users, or event volumes). This could be substantial as our user base grows, but it comes with vendor support and reduced need for additional headcount. A custom build incurs upfront engineering effort (potentially months of development) and ongoing maintenance costs (engineering time for monitoring, updates, fixing integrations when source systems change). However, it might avoid recurring vendor fees. We also considered the opportunity cost: engineers building a CDP are not working on product features – this is hard to quantify but important. We factored in that integrations in custom builds can consume up to 25% of IT budgets in large enterprises ([Top 6 Criteria to Evaluate CDP Integrations - ActionIQ](https://www.actioniq.com/blog/cdp-integrations/#:~:text=To%20support%20growth%20and%20evolving,which%20is%20a%20substantial%20cost)). We aimed to find an approach that is cost-effective over a 3-5 year horizon. A hybrid approach might moderate costs: e.g. use existing infrastructure (low incremental cost) plus a smaller spend on specific tools. We also looked at time-to-value: a vendor solution might deliver results in weeks, whereas custom could take many months before marketing sees benefits – delaying ROI.

Each approach was scored on these criteria. **Off-the-shelf** scored high on quick integration (assuming connectors for our tools) and low initial effort, but raised questions on long-term cost and data residency. **Custom build** scored high on control (compliance, tailored integration) but posed challenges in time, resources, and ensuring reliability at scale. **Hybrid solutions** appeared promising if we can exploit our current BigQuery “single source of truth” while adding components for real-time and activation needs.

### Refinement 
After evaluation, we refined our approach to a **final solution strategy** that balances flexibility, compliance, and impact:
- We propose a **hybrid (composable) CDP** implementation. This means leveraging our **existing data warehouse (BigQuery)** as the central storage and processing engine for unified customer data, while integrating a specialized CDP service or library for identity resolution and real-time data collection/activation. This choice was made because it is **technically compatible** with our stack and keeps sensitive data under our control (addressing compliance), yet avoids a fully ground-up build for complex features we can obtain from a vendor or open-source tool.
- The refined solution will **not** require us to rip-and-replace all systems. Instead, it will **layer on top of current infrastructure**, connecting tools like Amplitude and MoEngage via APIs or connectors to the central data platform. We concluded this approach is feasible given our engineering capabilities and the modular CDP products available. It offers a faster path to value than a purely custom build (we can deliver incremental capabilities in phases), and more flexibility than a monolithic off-the-shelf CDP (which might impose its own data model or require us to duplicate data into its storage).
- Importantly, this approach was chosen for its **expected impact**: it will unify data for the business without a long delay, and empower teams with self-service segmentation and personalization. By selecting a solution that fits our scalability needs and budget, we anticipate high adoption across marketing, product, and analytics teams. The decision was made collaboratively with stakeholders from each department to ensure the final approach meets cross-functional requirements. We will proceed with this refined solution into the design and implementation phase, with checkpoints to confirm it meets compliance standards and technical performance as envisioned.

## Proposed Solution
Based on the refined approach, this section outlines how the CDP will function within our existing ecosystem, the capabilities it will provide, integration details, data flow architecture, and how it will meet security/compliance needs. This is the blueprint to align product, engineering, and business stakeholders on what will be built.

### How the CDP Fits into Our Infrastructure
The proposed CDP will act as a **central hub for all customer data** and connect to our key systems. It will ingest data from various sources (app events, databases, third-party tools), unify that data into a single customer profile store, and then make that data available for use by marketing and product channels. Rather than a completely separate platform, the CDP is **embedded in our architecture** – it leverages BigQuery as the unified storage and uses connectors/APIs to interact with Amplitude, MoEngage, our membership service, payment service, CRM, etc. In effect, the CDP becomes the “brain” that consolidates and redistributes customer intelligence across the company.

**Key Capabilities:** The CDP will provide the following core capabilities to our teams:
- **Data Unification & Identity Resolution:** Merge customer data from all touchpoints into unified profiles. The CDP will reconcile identifiers (email, phone, device ID, user IDs) to ensure each person is represented as a single customer record. This creates a *“golden record”* per user containing their complete history ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=A%20CDP%20also%20helps%20marketers,personalized%20down%20to%20an%20individual)). Identity resolution will unify cross-device and cross-platform activity into one timeline ([What is a Customer Data Platform? CDPs Explained | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/resources/cdp/#:~:text=%2A%20Identity%20resolution%C2%A0,customer%20view%20for%20each%20user)).
- **User Segmentation:** Enable dynamic segmentation of users based on any combination of attributes or behaviors. Teams can define segments (e.g. “high-value senders who haven’t transacted in 30 days” or “users who referred >3 friends”) using a simple interface or query builder. The CDP will compute these segments and keep them updated in real-time or on schedule. These segments become targetable audiences for campaigns and analysis.
- **Personalization & Behavioral Targeting:** Provide data to personalize user experiences in both marketing channels and in-app. For example, the CDP can flag a user as “prefers sending on weekends” or “mostly transacts with Country X” based on their data, and those insights can drive personalized content (such as a tailored in-app message or personalized email offer). We will be able to orchestrate customer journeys that adapt to user behavior in real time.
- **Predictive Analytics & Scoring:** Leverage the unified data to generate predictive scores and insights (using analytics or machine learning models). The CDP will support computing metrics like **churn risk**, **customer lifetime value (CLTV)**, or **fraud risk** for each user. These scores become attributes in the user profile that can be used for segmentation or triggers (e.g. flag high fraud-risk accounts for review, or auto-enroll high-CLTV users into a VIP program). Over time, we can integrate our data science models into the CDP pipeline to enrich profiles with these predictive indicators.
- **Marketing Automation & Activation:** Directly connect to marketing and engagement tools to automate campaign execution. The CDP will have the capability to **trigger marketing actions** based on user events or segment membership – for instance, automatically send a push notification via MoEngage when a user completes their first transaction, or add a user to an email drip campaign when they meet certain criteria. It will also allow batch campaign orchestration (e.g. sending a promo email to all users in a segment) by pushing audience lists to our email service or ad platforms. Essentially, it bridges the gap between raw data and marketing engagement, enabling **real-time, data-driven outreach** ([What is a Customer Data Platform? CDPs Explained | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/resources/cdp/#:~:text=integrates%20into%20overall%20account%20activity)).
- **Analytics and Insights:** While we have analytics tools (Amplitude, BigQuery dashboards), the CDP will enhance analysis by providing ready-made segments and unified data exports. Analysts can easily do cohort analysis, funnel analysis, and measure campaign impact using the CDP’s single customer view. The CDP might include a UI for basic analytics on customer segments (e.g. size, activity trends) for business users. It ensures everyone is analyzing consistent data rather than pulling from different sources.

### Integration Points
To deliver the above capabilities, the CDP will integrate with a range of systems and data sources in our environment:
- **BigQuery (Data Warehouse):** BigQuery will serve as the central storage for unified profiles and historical customer data. The CDP will continuously sync data to BigQuery (e.g. storing raw events and curated profile tables) for analytics use. Likewise, any large datasets we already have in BigQuery (such as historical transaction records) will be ingested by the CDP to enrich customer profiles. The integration ensures that our “single source of truth” in BigQuery is in sync with the CDP – analysts can query CDP data in BigQuery, and the CDP can leverage BigQuery’s processing power for heavy computations. This also avoids duplicating large datasets outside our cloud, maintaining efficiency.
- **Amplitude (Product Analytics):** We will integrate Amplitude with the CDP so that user behavior events and cohorts are shared between the two. For instance, the CDP can ingest analytical events from Amplitude (app clickstreams, feature usage events) into the unified profile, providing context like “user opened app 5 times this week” or “clicked Feature X”. Conversely, we can export CDP-defined user properties or segments into Amplitude to enhance product analysis – e.g. tag events with user’s segment (new vs returning user) for deeper funnels. The goal is a two-way data flow: Amplitude contributes real-time behavior data to the CDP, and the CDP’s enriched data makes Amplitude reports more powerful. The integration will likely use Amplitude’s APIs or a direct pipeline to forward events.
- **MoEngage (Engagement Platform):** MoEngage will be a primary activation channel for the CDP. The CDP will push segments and user attributes to MoEngage, allowing highly targeted push notifications, in-app messages, and emails. For example, when the CDP identifies a “churn-risk” user segment, it can send that list to MoEngage, which then runs a re-engagement campaign for those users. We will set up real-time connectors (via webhook or MoEngage’s API) so that important events (like “user achieved milestone”) trigger MoEngage campaigns immediately. Additionally, MoEngage can feed engagement data back to the CDP – e.g. whether a user opened a notification – so we close the loop and have full campaign response data in the unified profile.
- **Membership Service (User Accounts):** The CDP will integrate with our membership database/service to pull in **user profile data** (e.g. account creation date, user demographics, KYC status, membership tier if any). This data is critical to enrich behavioral events with who the user is. The integration might be via direct database access or an API that sends user info to the CDP whenever a profile is created or updated. For example, when a new user signs up or updates their email, the CDP will receive that data so that profiles remain up-to-date. This ensures foundational attributes like age, location, verification status, etc., are part of the customer 360-view.
- **Payment Service (Transactions):** We will ingest transaction data from the payments system into the CDP. This includes P2P transfer events, amounts, timestamps, maybe payment instrument used, etc. These are key for segmentation (e.g. “users who sent > \$500 total in last month”). The integration can be a streaming feed of transactions or periodic batch loads from the payments database. By having transaction history in the CDP, we can enable use cases like detecting inactivity (no transactions in X days) or triggering cross-sell campaigns (if a user’s transaction volume qualifies them for a new feature or rewards). Payment data is sensitive, so this integration will be secured and likely remain within our cloud environment (the CDP will process it in BigQuery or a secure data pipeline).
- **CRM System:** If we have a CRM (for customer support or sales), the CDP will connect to it to both utilize and provide data. For example, if our CRM (like Salesforce) holds customer support interactions or manually assigned customer tags, that data can be ingested to enrich the profile (giving a full picture of user interactions). Conversely, the CDP can push information to CRM – e.g. flag high-value customers, or provide a customer’s recent activity to support agents. Integration may involve scheduled sync of data fields or on-demand API calls (for instance, when a support agent opens a customer record, an API could fetch the latest CDP profile data).
- **Email Marketing:** While MoEngage covers some email capabilities, we may have a dedicated email marketing tool or SMTP service for certain campaigns (like monthly newsletters or regulatory emails). The CDP will integrate by exporting targeted email lists or triggering webhook calls. For example, for a referral campaign, the CDP might hand off a list of users eligible for an email. We’ll ensure the CDP can format data (attributes needed in email templates) and send it to our email system securely. This guarantees consistent targeting across push and email – the same segment definitions apply.
- **Feature Flagging / Experimentation:** We will integrate the CDP with our feature flag system (e.g. LaunchDarkly or a homegrown solution) to enable data-driven feature rollouts. The CDP can supply user attributes or segments to the feature flag service so that new features can be enabled for specific user groups (for instance, enabling a beta feature only for “power users” segment defined in the CDP). This integration might work by the feature flag system querying the CDP’s API in real-time to decide if a user belongs to a segment before showing a feature. Additionally, the CDP will ingest experiment data – when we run A/B tests, we can feed the variant assignments and results into the unified profile for analysis (e.g. to later analyze how different segments responded to a feature).

Each integration point above will be defined with clear data flow contracts (what data is sent/received, frequency, and method). By connecting these systems, the CDP will function as the **data backbone**, ensuring all teams and tools are working off the same customer intelligence.

### Data Flow Architecture and Governance 
 ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/)) *Figure: Conceptual CDP architecture with data flowing from sources through ingestion, processing (cleaning, identity resolution, enrichment), into unified storage, and then to various consumption channels (analytics, collaboration via APIs, and activation for marketing) – all under data governance controls ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=The%20principal%20challenge%20of%20the,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)).*

At a high level, the CDP’s data flow will encompass several stages: **Data Ingestion, Processing, Storage, and Activation**, with overarching governance at each step ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=The%20principal%20challenge%20of%20the,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)). Below is an outline of how data will move and be managed in the system:

- **Ingestion:** The CDP will collect data from all relevant sources in both real-time and batch modes. This includes streaming ingestion of live events (e.g. user actions from the app via SDKs or event bus), scheduled batch imports (e.g. nightly sync of the day’s transaction records from the payment DB), and connector-based pulls (e.g. fetching user attributes from the membership service or CRM via API). The ingestion layer will support **multiple data formats and sources** – events, relational data, files – and convert them into a standardized format for processing ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=The%20principal%20challenge%20of%20the,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)). Connectors/adapters will be built for each integration point described above. For example, a streaming pipeline (using Pub/Sub or Kafka) might feed app events into the CDP within seconds, while a batch ETL job loads user account updates from a MySQL backup daily. This layer will enforce data validation on input (rejecting malformed events, etc.) and tag each incoming data point with a consistent user identifier (if available) for downstream joining.
- **Processing and Profile Building:** Once data is ingested, it enters the processing layer. Here the CDP will perform **data cleaning and transformation** to normalize fields (e.g. ensuring consistent timestamp formats, categorizing transaction types) and then execute **identity resolution** logic ([The Warehouse Native Customer Data Platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/the-warehouse-native-customer-data-platform/#:~:text=,for%20downstream%20teams%20and%20tools)). Identity resolution means linking records that belong to the same user: for instance, connecting an anonymous app event with a logged-in user profile once we have a login event that ties device ID to user ID. The CDP will maintain an identity graph or mapping (possibly using deterministic joins on emails, device IDs, etc. and heuristic matching as needed) to unify profiles. After resolution, the system does **profile aggregation and enrichment** – combining all data for a user into a single profile structure, and computing additional attributes. For example, as data arrives, we update running totals (like total amount sent by user, last active date), assign the user to any new segments they qualify for, and calculate predictive scores (if models are integrated in pipeline). We will likely implement a rules engine or use SQL in BigQuery for these transformations. The output of processing is a set of **curated data tables**: e.g. a master user profile table with one record per user (including latest attributes and segment memberships), and tables for each defined segment or event stream for easy querying. This processing can occur in micro-batches or near-real-time streams for low latency. The CDP will separate **raw data, cleaned data, and curated data** layers to apply governance (raw logs are stored for audit, but only curated results are used for activation) ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=layered%20architecture%20where%20the%20sources,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)).  
- **Storage (Unified Customer Database):** All processed data is stored in a **central data repository**. In our case, this will be implemented in BigQuery (and possibly an indexed cache for real-time lookups). We will maintain different zones: a *raw data lake* (all events and records as ingested, in BigQuery or cloud storage), a *cleaned/intermediate layer*, and a *curated database* of profiles and segments ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=layered%20architecture%20where%20the%20sources,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)). The curated profiles are the heart of the CDP – each profile contains keys (user ID, etc.), attributes (demographics, preferences, scores), and links to event histories. This storage is designed for both analytics (BigQuery allows analytical SQL queries on profiles/events) and fast retrieval (we may use an in-memory store or search index for quick API access to a single profile). Data governance is strongly enforced at the storage layer: **access controls, encryption, and auditing** are applied to all stored data ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=The%20principal%20challenge%20of%20the,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)). For instance, PII fields may be encrypted or tokenized at rest, and access policies will restrict who can view sensitive attributes. The storage will also keep metadata (a data catalog) describing each attribute/field in the profile, its source, and update lineage – this helps with data governance and trust in the unified data.
- **Activation & Consumption:** The final stage is making the unified data available to **business tools and users**. The CDP will have an **activation layer** that pushes data to downstream systems and supports queries ([An overview and architecture of building a Customer Data Platform on AWS | AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-and-architecture-building-customer-data-platform-on-aws/#:~:text=The%20principal%20challenge%20of%20the,Cataloging%3B%20and%20Consumption)). For marketing activation, this means exporting segment lists and triggering webhooks as described in the integration section (to MoEngage, email, etc.). For product, this could mean an API endpoint where the app or feature flag system can query a user’s profile or segment in real-time. For analytics, this means pipelines or connectors that update BI dashboards or feed data science notebooks with the latest unified data (alternatively, analysts can query BigQuery directly since it’s kept in sync). We will implement APIs for key CDP functions: e.g. *getProfile(userID)*, *listUsersInSegment(segment_name)*, *triggerEvent(userID, event)* for external systems to interface with the CDP programmatically. Additionally, a user interface or configuration UI will be available (likely vendor-provided or a simple internal tool) for marketers to create segments, define journeys, and view profile attributes without SQL – making the CDP accessible to non-engineering teams. Every activation will be logged and monitored to ensure data flows are consistent and to provide an audit trail of how data is used.

- **Data Governance & Quality:** Overarching the entire architecture is strong governance. We will establish data quality checks at each stage (for example, monitoring for drop-offs in event ingestion, or anomalies in profile counts). The CDP will include features to detect and handle PII appropriately (automatically flagging personal data fields and ensuring they are protected) ([Navigating data compliance: How to use a CDP to ensure privacy | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/blog/data-compliance-cdp-privacy/#:~:text=In%20a%20nutshell%2C%20it%20works,to%20your%20business%E2%80%99s%20privacy%20policy)). Compliance rules (discussed more below) will be built into the pipelines – for instance, if a user withdraws consent for marketing, the CDP should propagate that update and exclude the user from all marketing segments (and notify connected tools to do the same). We’ll maintain an **audit log** of data access and changes: who viewed/exported data, when profile merges happened, etc., to satisfy internal audit and external regulations. Data governance also means documentation: the data catalog will document what each customer attribute means and its source, so all teams use data consistently. By governing the data centrally in the CDP, we avoid the previous situation of each tool having slightly different numbers or definitions for metrics. 

Overall, this architecture ensures that data flows **seamlessly yet securely** from sources to activation. The unified profile storage in BigQuery allows heavy analysis and AI modeling, while the real-time pipelines and APIs ensure we can act on data instantly for personalization. Governance is embedded at every step to maintain data integrity, security, and compliance.

### Security and Compliance Requirements
Implementing a CDP in a financial context demands rigorous security and compliance measures. The solution will adhere to **privacy-by-design** principles and meet all relevant regulations (like GDPR, CCPA, and financial data protection standards):

- **Data Security & Encryption:** All customer data handled by the CDP will be encrypted both **in transit and at rest**. We will use TLS for all data transfers between systems and encrypt data at rest in BigQuery and any storage using strong encryption (AES-256 or GCP managed keys). Sensitive personal data (PII such as names, emails, phone numbers) may be additionally encrypted or tokenized within the CDP such that even internal access requires decryption keys. This ensures that if any storage or backup were compromised, the data remains unreadable. A good CDP solution will support robust encryption mechanisms – we will verify encryption capabilities (the CDP should **turn data into ciphertext unreadable without keys** ([Navigating data compliance: How to use a CDP to ensure privacy | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/blog/data-compliance-cdp-privacy/#:~:text=your%20business%20requires,a%20CDP%20that%20can%20offer))). Key management will follow best practices (keys stored in secure vaults with limited access).
- **Access Control & Authentication:** We will enforce strict **role-based access control** (RBAC) for the CDP data and tools. Only authorized personnel can access the CDP platform and data, with permissions segmented by role (e.g. marketers can create segments but might not see raw PII data; analysts can query data but only through approved interfaces; engineers have admin rights to manage pipelines, etc.). Access to especially sensitive fields (like full financial transaction details) can be further restricted or masked. All access and actions will be authenticated (integrating with our SSO/identity provider for user logins to the CDP interface) and logged for audit. We will also implement **access audits** regularly – reviewing who has access to what and ensuring least privilege.
- **Compliance with GDPR and Data Privacy Laws:** The CDP will include features to comply with user data rights. We will maintain a **consent management** mechanism: each user profile will store the user’s consent preferences (for marketing emails, push notifications, data processing, etc.). The system will honor these flags by automatically excluding users from segments or data exports if they have opted out (for example, CDP can create suppression segments for users who withdrew consent) ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=,data%20privacy%20and%20residency%20regulations)). For **data subject requests** (like GDPR’s right to erasure or right to access), we will have processes to retrieve all data on a given user or delete it entirely from the CDP and all connected systems. The CDP’s unified nature actually helps here – one command can purge a user’s data from all integrated systems if needed. We’ll ensure the CDP (or our process around it) can erase or anonymize a profile on demand and confirm propagation to downstream tools. Privacy notices will be updated to cover CDP data usage, and we will obtain any necessary user consents for the additional data processing.
- **Financial Regulations:** As a peer-to-peer payments provider, we also consider regulations like PCI DSS (if handling payment card data) and other local financial data protection guidelines. While the CDP will not store sensitive card details (those remain in payment systems isolated per PCI scope), it will store transaction metadata. We’ll ensure compliance by not ingesting any data that puts the CDP in scope for PCI (e.g. no card numbers – only transaction IDs, timestamps, amounts, which are fine). For anti-money-laundering (AML) and KYC data, if those are integrated, we will treat them with highest sensitivity and ensure any AML-specific handling is followed. Our compliance team will review all data ingested to make sure nothing violates regulations or our privacy policy.
- **Data Governance Policies:** We will establish a clear data governance policy for the CDP ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=,collection%20and%20usage%2C%20including%20providing)). This policy will define what data is collected, permissible uses of data, retention periods, and deletion protocols. For example, we might decide to retain detailed event data for only 2 years in the CDP, aggregating or archiving older data to reduce risk. We’ll also govern data quality – setting standards for data accuracy and consistency. Part of governance is ensuring **data lineage** is traceable (so we know source of each piece of data and how it’s transformed). If we use any third-party data in the CDP, we will ensure we have the rights to use it and that it’s properly integrated.
- **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Security isn’t just about keeping outsiders out – we also need to detect any unusual activity within. The CDP will have monitoring to detect anomalies, such as large data exports or unusual query patterns that could indicate misuse. We will set up alerts for breaches or suspicious behavior. For instance, if an internal user attempts to extract a large volume of PII or if an external integration starts pulling more data than normal, it will trigger an alert for security review. We’ll also employ rate limiting and other controls on APIs to prevent abuse.
- **Penetration Testing & Audits:** Before going live, the CDP (especially if custom built) will undergo security testing. This includes penetration testing of any new APIs and an architecture review to ensure no obvious vulnerabilities. If we use a vendor or open-source component, we’ll review their security certifications (SOC2, ISO 27001, etc.) and possibly run our own limited pentests if allowed. Regular audits (both internal and external) will be scheduled to maintain compliance — e.g. annual GDPR compliance audit to ensure our deletion process works, or IT audits on access logs.
- **Data Residency and Isolation:** If needed, we will ensure data residency requirements are met. For example, if we have EU users, we might deploy the CDP infrastructure in an EU data center or configure BigQuery to store EU data in EU region. The CDP solution we choose will ideally allow for **single-tenant deployment or regional isolation** ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=,and%20deploy%20it%20across%20regions)) so that our data isn’t co-mingled with other companies’ data (for both security and compliance). This isolation can reduce the risk of cross-tenant data leaks and gives us more control over upgrade cycles or changes.

By implementing these security and compliance measures, we aim to make the CDP a **trustworthy system** that enhances our use of data while fully protecting it. The compliance team will be involved throughout design and implementation to validate that all regulatory obligations are met. This approach not only avoids penalties and risks but also builds customer trust that their data is handled responsibly.

## Use Cases
With the CDP in place, various teams (marketing, product, data/analytics) will be able to execute powerful use cases that were previously difficult or impossible. Below are key use cases by domain, illustrating how the CDP will drive value:

### Marketing Use Cases
- **Personalized User Engagement:** Marketing can deliver highly personalized campaigns based on unified customer data. For example, we could create a segment of users who signed up but haven’t made a transfer in 2 weeks and send them a tailored push notification offering a first-transfer discount. Or, identify users who frequently receive money but never send, and target them with a campaign highlighting the benefits of sending money. The CDP enables these by combining behavior and transaction data to find relevant users and automatically triggering messaging via MoEngage or email. We expect improved click-through and conversion rates from such personalized outreach – indeed, **91% of consumers are more likely to engage with brands that provide relevant offers and recommendations** ([Customer Data Platforms for Solving 5 Key Marketing Challenges - Algonomy](https://algonomy.com/blogs/customer-data-platform/5-marketing-challenges-a-customer-data-platform-cdp-can-solve/#:~:text=retailers%20to%20identify%20revenue%20opportunities,across%20their%20customer%20base)), highlighting the impact of personalization on engagement.
- **Churn Prediction & Retention Campaigns:** Using CDP data, we will develop a churn prediction model that flags users at risk of dropping out (e.g. decreasing activity, negative app experiences). The CDP can maintain a **churn_risk score** for each user. Marketing can set up an automated retention journey: when a user’s risk score crosses a threshold, the CDP adds them to a “at-risk” segment and triggers a win-back campaign (such as an email with a special offer or a personal message highlighting new features). This allows proactive intervention before the user actually churns ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=)). We can also A/B test different retention incentives on these segments to see what works best. The unified data means we’ll know if the user came back (e.g. did a transfer) after the campaign, accurately measuring campaign effectiveness in reducing churn.
- **A/B Testing and Campaign Optimization:** The CDP will facilitate more rigorous A/B testing for marketing. For example, we might test two different push notification messages for promoting a new feature. The CDP can randomly split a segment into test groups or simply record which users got variant A vs B (via integration with the messaging tool), and then track downstream metrics (opens, conversions like completing a transfer). Because all data (campaign exposure and resulting behavior) is unified, marketing analysts can easily compare outcomes. Additionally, the CDP can ensure that users in test vs control are similar by using profile attributes (to avoid bias). We could also test sending a campaign to one segment vs not sending to a holdout group to measure lift in retention. The platform thus supports a **test-and-learn culture** in marketing, with quick iteration. Insights from these tests (e.g. which segment is most responsive to certain offers) feed back into the CDP as new attributes or refined segments for future targeting.

### Product Use Cases
- **Feature Adoption Analysis:** Product managers can utilize the CDP’s unified data to understand how different users adopt new app features. For instance, after releasing a “split payment” feature, the CDP can help identify what percentage of users have tried it, and what their characteristics are (Did they have higher past transaction volumes? Are they mostly users who receive money frequently?). We can define cohorts like “users who used Feature X within first week of release” vs “those who did not” and analyze their engagement or retention. This helps product teams identify obstacles (if a certain segment isn’t using the feature, maybe they need education or the feature needs improvement). Because the data is unified, we can also correlate feature adoption with marketing touches – e.g. did the users who used the feature get an email about it via marketing? Such insights guide how we rollout and promote features to the right users.
- **Contextual In-App Notifications:** The CDP can enable real-time, contextual messages inside the app to enhance user experience. For example, if a user just received a large sum of money, the app (through the CDP) could pop up a context-specific suggestion: “You received £500 – consider using our new investment feature to grow your balance.” This is driven by the CDP detecting a certain event (large receive) and the user’s profile (maybe marked as interested in investment) and sending a trigger to the app’s notification system. Another scenario: a user triggers an error (like a failed transfer), the CDP can log it and the app can immediately show a tailored help prompt or later the CDP can cue the support team to reach out. These **micro-personalizations** in the product increase relevance and can guide users through the app. They rely on the CDP’s event stream and profile attributes to decide when and what to show.
- **Automated User Onboarding Journeys:** We will create an automated onboarding flow for new users using the CDP. For instance, when a new user signs up, the CDP puts them in a “New User – Day 0” segment. After 1 day, if they haven’t made a transfer, the CDP triggers a push notification: “Need help making your first transfer? Here’s a guide.” If after 3 days they still haven’t, maybe trigger an email with testimonials to build trust. Once they do make a first transfer, the CDP moves them to the next stage segment (“Onboarded – made first transfer”) and could then trigger content about inviting friends or exploring other features. This **lifecycle marketing** can largely be automated by the CDP’s rules and integration with messaging tools, ensuring each user gets timely, context-appropriate messages to drive activation. The product team can design this journey once, and the CDP will execute it consistently for every new user, freeing up manual effort and improving activation rates.

### Data & Analytics Use Cases
- **Cohort and CLTV Analysis:** Our analytics team can perform powerful cohort analysis now that the CDP consolidates data. For example, we can create cohorts of users by the month they joined or by certain behaviors (cohort of users who made >3 transfers in first week vs those who made none) and track their retention and lifetime value over time. With unified data, calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** for different segments is straightforward – we can sum each user’s transaction fee contributions or other revenue metrics over their lifetime, and the CDP can provide a CLTV score. We could find that users acquired via a referral have 20% higher CLTV than those from paid ads, for instance. These insights help the business allocate marketing spend and also identify what good customers “look like” to guide product decisions. The CDP’s unified view ensures the numbers are consistent (marketing and finance will not argue over different definitions) since it’s one platform providing the data.
- **Predictive Fraud Detection:** By unifying real-time behavioral data with transaction data, the CDP can feed into our fraud detection systems. For example, we can use the CDP to aggregate unusual patterns (multiple accounts sending money to the same recipient, rapid small transfers that might indicate structuring, etc.). A machine learning model could run on CDP data to flag potential fraud or suspicious users. The results (fraud risk score or anomaly flag) become part of the user’s profile in the CDP. The moment a user’s behavior triggers a high risk score, the CDP can alert our fraud team or automatically route that user’s transactions for additional verification. The value here is combining data that’s often separate: device info, login pattern, transaction history, referral sources – a CDP profile can provide a holistic view to better catch fraud than any single system alone ([The power of customer data, analytics, and privacy-compliant personalization for financial services - CDP Institute](https://www.cdpinstitute.org/lytics/the-power-of-customer-data-analytics-and-privacy-compliant-personalization-for-financial-services/#:~:text=)). Also, because it operates in real-time (or near real-time), it can prevent fraud rather than just detect it after the fact.
- **360° Customer Insights & Reporting:** The data team can create richer analytics dashboards powered by the CDP. For instance, a **customer 360 dashboard** for business stakeholders might show key metrics like active users, average send amount, retention rates, broken down by meaningful segments (geography, tenure, etc.) all derived from CDP data. With a CDP, we can easily drill down into a single customer’s journey across all touchpoints if needed (useful for troubleshooting or VIP customers). We can also do **multi-channel attribution analysis** – understanding how marketing channels and in-app behaviors together lead to conversions. Because the CDP tracks the full funnel (ad click -> app install -> transactions -> referrals, etc.), analysts can attribute credit to each touchpoint properly. Another use case is modeling and forecasting: the CDP data can feed predictive models (like predicting month-by-month active users or revenue) with greater accuracy since it has complete, cleaned data. In summary, the CDP becomes the analytical foundation for data-driven decision making, allowing our data science and BI teams to generate insights faster and with more confidence in accuracy.

These use cases demonstrate tangible ways the CDP will be used day-to-day. They bridge the objectives of different teams, all relying on the same platform, thereby **aligning marketing, product, and analytics on common data and goals**. As we implement, we will prioritize these use cases to ensure the CDP development is delivering immediate value (for example, starting with basic personalization and cohort analytics, then layering on predictive models, etc.).

## Functional Requirements
To support the above solution and use cases, the CDP must meet a comprehensive set of functional requirements. These define what the system should do (features and capabilities):

- **Multi-Source Data Collection:** The CDP must collect data from **all relevant sources** – including mobile apps, web (if applicable), backend databases, and third-party tools. It should provide SDKs or APIs to capture real-time events from our apps (e.g. user actions like send money, open app) and also connectors/ETL for batch data (e.g. nightly sync of transaction tables). Data from disparate sources (Amplitude, MoEngage exports, etc.) should be ingestible into the CDP. The ingestion process should standardize the data into a unified schema where possible (consistent field names for user ID, timestamps, etc.). It should handle high event throughput without data loss and ensure idempotency (no duplicate records on retries).
- **Identity Resolution & Profile Unification:** The system must be able to **identify unique users across devices and data sources**, merging their data into one profile. This involves linking different identifiers – for example, if a user initially is known by a device ID and later by a login ID, the CDP should merge those records. It needs a configurable identity resolution logic (deterministic matching on unique IDs, and possibly fuzzy matching on emails/names if needed in some cases). The outcome is a unified customer profile that aggregates all attributes and event history for that individual ([What is a Customer Data Platform? CDPs Explained | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/resources/cdp/#:~:text=%2A%20Identity%20resolution%C2%A0,customer%20view%20for%20each%20user)). The CDP should prevent duplicate profiles (or provide a way to merge them if found). This also implies maintaining an **ID graph** or mapping table behind the scenes. Identity resolution should work in real-time (as soon as a linking identifier is available) so that subsequent data is correctly attached to the unified profile.
- **Real-Time Processing & Activation:** The platform should support **real-time (or near real-time) data processing** for immediate use cases. For example, when a significant event occurs (like “user made first transfer”), the CDP should process that event and update the user’s profile/segments within seconds, then trigger any downstream actions (like send a welcome message webhook). This means the architecture should include streaming capabilities and low-latency data propagation. Similarly, when a user enters or exits a segment (like becomes “inactive for 30 days”), the CDP should promptly activate the relevant campaign or flag. Real-time APIs are needed for any on-demand queries (e.g. the app asking for profile info). Latency from event ingestion to action should ideally be under a few seconds for critical triggers. Batch processing is acceptable for less time-sensitive updates (like recomputing a churn score daily).
- **Batch Processing and Backfills:** In addition to real-time, the CDP must handle **batch workloads** efficiently. This includes bulk importing historical data (backfilling last year’s transactions into profiles), running nightly jobs to re-calculate metrics or scores for all users, and producing scheduled reports. The system should be able to process large volumes (potentially billions of records) in batch without errors. It should support scheduling and orchestration of these jobs, and have retry mechanisms for any failures. Batch support ensures that if we onboard the CDP and want to load all past data or periodically rebuild a model output for all users, we can do so. Both batch and streaming should result in a consistent state in the profile store.
- **User Segmentation Engine:** A core requirement is the ability to create and manage user segments. The CDP should allow defining segment rules based on profile attributes and events (e.g. “Country = UK AND last_transfer_date > 30 days ago”). This could be through a visual builder for marketers and/or via writing SQL or conditions. The engine should evaluate these rules continuously or on a schedule, updating segment membership as data changes. It should handle segmentation on large data sets (millions of users) efficiently. Also needed is **segment export** functionality: the ability to pull the list of users in a segment at any time, either via UI or API. We require support for both simple segments and complex ones (nested conditions, time-window criteria, etc.). The segmentation should tie into activation – e.g. linking a segment to a campaign. The system must also maintain metadata about segments (name, description, creation date, owner) for governance.
- **Campaign and Journey Orchestration:** While deep campaign management might occur in MoEngage or an ESP, the CDP should have basic journey orchestration capabilities or at least integration hooks. For instance, the CDP could have a rule like “if user enters Segment X, trigger Action Y”. Actions could be a webhook, an API call, or adding the user to a messaging queue. We need the CDP to support setting up these **real-time triggers** easily (without needing custom code each time). This effectively allows automated campaigns to run based on data changes. If the chosen CDP solution doesn’t natively orchestrate journeys, it must at least seamlessly inform the tools that do (e.g. pass the right data to MoEngage to handle the journey logic there).
- **APIs and Webhooks:** The CDP must expose **APIs** for external systems to interact with it. Key APIs include retrieving profile data (for a given user ID or email), querying segment membership (is user X in segment Y?), and perhaps writing data (if we need to ingest via API). Secure RESTful endpoints or GraphQL could be provided for these. Additionally, **webhook capabilities** are required for the CDP to call out to other systems when certain events occur. For example, a webhook to our backend when an important user milestone is reached, or to an external partner system. These should be configurable (URL, payload, triggers) and reliable (with retry logic, logging of delivery). Real-time integration with other applications will heavily rely on these APIs/webhooks.
- **Data Unification & Profile Storage:** The CDP needs robust data storage for all the unified information. Functionally, it should store: user identifiers (multiple), attributes (potentially hundreds per user over time), event timelines (or at least links to events stored externally), segment tags, and more. We require that this profile database be queryable (for internal analytics and to drive segments). The CDP should support **extensibility of the data schema** – as we add new data sources or define new attributes (like a new predictive score), we need to incorporate those into profiles. It should not be a fixed schema that’s hard to change. Also, the storage should handle **high cardinality data** (millions of unique users, and many events per user) without performance issues. 
- **Data Activation Connectors:** Beyond MoEngage/Amplitude, we might integrate additional channels (Google/Facebook Ads for audience targeting, other push notification services, etc.). The CDP should have or allow building **connectors to external systems** for activation. This includes the ability to send segment data to ad platforms (e.g. syncing an audience to Google Ads Customer Match), to send data to data partners or data lakes if needed, and to integrate with any internal systems that could use customer data (maybe a recommendation engine). Connectors should support transformation of data to the format required by targets and ensure secure transfer. Ideally, the CDP solution comes with a library of common connectors (for CRM, ad networks, analytics tools) to speed up integration.
- **Consent and Preference Management:** As a functional aspect tied to compliance, the CDP should incorporate user consent statuses. That means it should record whether a user has opted in/out of various communication types or data processing. Functionally, it needs to allow ingestion of consent updates (from, say, our preferences center) and then **apply those preferences** – e.g. preventing an opted-out user from being included in a marketing export. This can be considered a functional requirement to ensure the system’s outputs are compliant by design.
- **Auditing and Versioning:** The CDP should have the ability to **audit changes** (who created a segment, who activated a campaign, etc.) and possibly version important configurations. For example, if a segment definition is edited, it’s useful to version it to recover or compare. While not a user-facing “feature” in the traditional sense, this is a requirement for maintainability and trust, ensuring we can trace how a certain outcome came about (e.g., “this user was sent a promo because they were in Segment X as defined on date Y by person Z”).

In summary, the CDP must function as an end-to-end system for collecting, unifying, and activating customer data. It should be **highly responsive** for real-time needs while also **powerful in batch** for large-scale analytics. All the functional parts — ingestion methods, identity resolution, segmentation, APIs, etc. — need to work together seamlessly to deliver the use cases described earlier. We will validate each of these requirements during vendor selection or design of the custom solution.

*(For reference, these functional needs align with standard CDP definitions: e.g. identity resolution unifying histories into one view ([What is a Customer Data Platform? CDPs Explained | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/resources/cdp/#:~:text=%2A%20Identity%20resolution%C2%A0,customer%20view%20for%20each%20user)) and activation pushing audiences to various tools ([What is a Customer Data Platform? CDPs Explained | Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/resources/cdp/#:~:text=integrates%20into%20overall%20account%20activity)) are core features we expect the platform to provide.)*

## Non-Functional Requirements
In addition to the features, the CDP must meet several **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** that ensure it operates reliably, securely, and efficiently at scale. These are critical for engineering and IT to agree on, as they affect long-term sustainability:

- **Scalability:** The CDP architecture must scale to accommodate growth in user base and data volume. This means it should handle increasing load by adding resources without major refactoring. We anticipate supporting millions of users and high event throughput (peaks of hundreds of events per second). The system should scale horizontally (e.g. more processing nodes or cloud resources) to manage peak loads, such as a surge in events during a marketing campaign. Both data storage and processing pipelines should be scalable – e.g. BigQuery can handle petabytes of data, and the streaming pipeline can partition load across multiple consumers. Load testing will be done to ensure performance doesn’t degrade at high volumes. We’ll also design with scalability patterns (like batching, backpressure on streams) to gracefully handle bursts. In summary, the CDP should meet current needs and scale at least **5x** of current volumes with minimal changes.
- **Performance & Latency:** For real-time use cases, the CDP should provide low-latency processing. Our goal is that from the moment an event occurs (or a profile attribute changes), the relevant updates (profile, segment, trigger) occur within a few seconds. API calls to the CDP (e.g. to fetch a profile) should respond in milliseconds (ideally <200ms) to not introduce lag in our app or other systems. Batch processing jobs (like nightly aggregations) should complete within their designated window (say, a few hours overnight) to be ready by morning business hours. We will set specific SLAs: for instance, segment evaluation runs to refresh campaign audiences must finish in time for scheduled sends, and the system should be capable of streaming events with sub-second end-to-end latency for critical triggers. Latency requirements will influence our technology choices (possibly using in-memory stores or stream processors for speed).
- **Reliability & High Availability:** The CDP will become a central piece of infrastructure, so it must be highly available. We target at least **99.9% uptime** for the CDP services (approximately < 8 hours of downtime per year), as downtime would halt campaigns and possibly affect in-app features. To achieve this, we’ll deploy redundant components: e.g. multiple instances of any CDP service running in different availability zones. The system should have no single point of failure – cluster and failover mechanisms in place for databases, message queues, etc. We’ll also implement health checks and automatic restart/failover for services that go down. Maintenance updates should be doable with zero or minimal downtime (rolling deployments). Additionally, the CDP should be reliable in terms of data integrity: no data loss or corruption. We will use durable storage for event logs and ensure exactly-once or at-least-once processing as appropriate so that all data is accounted for even in case of failures.
- **Disaster Recovery:** In case of a major outage or data loss event (e.g. cloud region failure, catastrophic bug), we need a Disaster Recovery plan. This includes **regular backups** of critical data (customer profiles, configuration, etc.) to a secure offsite location or a different region. We will define RPO/RTO targets – for example: an RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of at most 1 hour (meaning we could lose at most 1 hour of data changes) and an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of perhaps a few hours (meaning we can restore service in that time). The CDP should support backup and restore processes (if using BigQuery, backups can be done via snapshot exports). For the real-time pipeline, having a standby in another region could be considered. We’ll document the steps to fail over to a backup environment if needed. Disaster recovery drills will be conducted to ensure we can actually recover within the defined targets.
- **Security (Infrastructure):** Beyond data encryption and access (covered in compliance), the system must be secure from an infrastructure standpoint. This means using secure network architecture (e.g. VPCs, restricting inbound internet access to the CDP components, using firewalls). All servers or cloud services should be kept updated with security patches. We’ll apply security best practices from devops: least privilege for service accounts, secrets management for API keys, intrusion detection on critical systems, etc. Non-functional security also implies the system is resilient to attacks – e.g. it should withstand a DDOS or heavy load without crashing (auto-scaling helps here). Also, if using a vendor, ensure their platform meets our security checklist. We might require features like SAML SSO for the CDP UI, and audit logs as discussed. Essentially, the CDP should not introduce new vulnerabilities to our IT landscape.
- **Compliance & Privacy Maintenance:** The CDP must continuously adhere to GDPR and other regulations in operation. Non-functionally, this means performance of compliance tasks: e.g. if a user requests data deletion, the system should be able to remove their data across all components within a reasonable time (say 30 days at absolute max, but preferably much sooner). It should also be able to **mask or withhold certain data** based on user consent in real-time (for instance, if a user opted out of tracking, the CDP shouldn’t even ingest their events). These are functional at a glance, but also NFRs in the sense that compliance must be upheld even under load or failures. For instance, if the system is recovering from downtime, it should not “forget” to enforce consent rules. Privacy-by-design must persist in all circumstances.
- **Maintainability & Extensibility:** The CDP should be built/configured in a way that is maintainable by our engineering team long-term. This means clear documentation, modular architecture, and monitoring. It should be straightforward to onboard new engineers to work on the CDP. Also, adding new data sources or new attributes in the future should be relatively easy (extensible design). We anticipate that business needs will evolve (e.g. adding a new channel or product line), so the CDP should accommodate that without a complete redesign. This might mean choosing flexible schema storage and a scalable identity resolution logic that can incorporate new ID types. Maintainability also includes having automated tests for data pipelines and alerting systems (observability) so that issues are caught and can be debugged quickly. We should measure error rates, processing lags, etc., with dashboards for the devops team.
- **Performance Efficiency & Cost Optimization:** While not a direct “must-have” feature, we set an expectation that the CDP will be cost-efficient in operation (which is a non-functional quality). We will monitor resource usage – e.g. BigQuery costs for queries, compute costs for streaming – and ensure the system is designed to minimize waste (through things like data partitioning, aggregating data before storage, and auto-scaling down when not in use). The architecture should avoid excessively expensive operations (like full data scans) in normal operation. This ensures the CDP remains financially sustainable to run. If using a vendor, the contract should ideally allow cost predictability or scaling with usage in a known way, and we must ensure we’re not paying for unnecessary features.

Meeting these non-functional requirements is essential to align engineering (who will build/maintain the CDP) with business (who needs it to be dependable and compliant). We will include these NFRs in our design review and test plans. For example, load testing will validate scalability, security testing will validate the controls, etc., before full deployment.

## Stakeholder Considerations
Implementing a CDP impacts multiple stakeholders across the organization. It is critical to address the needs and concerns of each group and define ownership to ensure smooth adoption and ongoing success:

- **Marketing Team:** The marketing team will be one of the primary users of the CDP. This solution empowers them with richer data and segmentation capabilities, enabling more precise targeting and personalized campaigns. They will benefit from **self-serve access** to create segments and launch campaigns without always relying on data analysts – accelerating campaign deployment. However, this comes with a learning curve: marketers will need training on the CDP interface and its best practices (how to build effective segments, interpret new metrics, etc.). We must involve marketing early in defining segment criteria and use cases so the platform is built to support their real needs (e.g. specific segment filters or KPIs they care about). Also, marketing operations will likely take on day-to-day usage of the CDP (creating audiences, scheduling campaigns). We should identify a marketing point person (or a small team) who will become the internal experts on using the CDP and liaison with the engineering team for any issues. From a process standpoint, marketing campaigns might shift – for example, rather than pulling CSV lists from an analyst, they’ll directly fetch from CDP – we’ll need to update SOPs accordingly. Overall, by aligning with marketing’s goals (improving conversion, retention, campaign ROI), we ensure they champion the CDP. We will set **KPIs like uplift in campaign response rates and reduction in time to launch campaigns** to measure marketing’s success with the CDP.
- **Product Team:** The product management and growth teams will leverage the CDP for user insights and in-app personalization. They stand to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior (via unified profiles) which will inform product decisions. For instance, knowing which features are used by which user segments can guide feature improvements or new feature ideas. The CDP also enables product-led growth experiments (like personalized upsells) and faster iteration on those. The product team’s consideration is that some in-app features might now depend on CDP data (for example, showing user-specific content based on CDP profile). This requires close collaboration with engineering to integrate CDP APIs into the app, and there’s a dependency: if the CDP is down, those app features might be affected. We’ll mitigate this with graceful fallbacks (the app should still function if CDP data isn’t immediately available, perhaps showing default content). Product managers should be involved in defining events and attributes tracked in the CDP to ensure they get the analytics they need. They will also coordinate with marketing on combined initiatives (like lifecycle communications that blend product and marketing touchpoints). It’s important to set expectations on what product can get from the CDP (for example, real-time capabilities) so they design features with those in mind. The product team might also own certain segments (e.g. “power users” definition) that they use for beta features – so a process to manage and approve such definitions is needed.
- **Data & Analytics Team:** This team (data analysts, data scientists, BI) will likely *manage the CDP backend* (especially if it’s built on our data warehouse) and also be power users of the data. They are critical stakeholders for implementation – they will work on configuring data pipelines, ensuring data quality, and possibly building models (churn, CLTV) that integrate with the CDP. The CDP can reduce some of their workload in servicing ad-hoc data requests, because marketing and product can self-serve many needs. However, initially it will increase workload as they help set up the system and validate that the unified data is correct and trustworthy. Data engineers/analysts will need to define data schemas, transformation logic, and maintain documentation. The analytics team will also use the CDP to perform advanced analysis (like the cohort studies and attribution mentioned). They must verify that the metrics from the CDP align with legacy reports to avoid discrepancies – a reconciliation phase might be needed. Additionally, they will likely govern the **data taxonomy** (consistent naming and definitions of events and attributes) to maintain clarity across teams. We should clarify operational ownership: likely, the Data team or a specialized “Customer Data Team” will own the maintenance of CDP data pipelines, similar to how they own the data warehouse. This means they’ll monitor data freshness, fix any ETL issues, manage data retention, etc. In terms of team impact, the CDP could free them from repetitive data combining tasks, allowing them to focus on deeper analysis and model building, which is a positive outcome.
- **Compliance & Legal Team:** Given the sensitivity of user data in a financial app, our compliance team will be heavily involved. They will oversee that the CDP implementation adheres to privacy laws and internal policies. Their considerations include verifying that **data usage in the CDP has a lawful basis** (e.g. checking that our terms of service allow this kind of data processing, and updating them if needed), and that we respect user consent choices at every step. The compliance team will likely require periodic audits of the CDP, so we need to facilitate that (e.g. provide audit logs, data flow diagrams, etc.). They may also want to approve the choice of any third-party vendor for the CDP (ensuring they’re compliant and ideally adding data processing agreements in place). During implementation, compliance will advise on data minimization (not to ingest more data than necessary) and on retention schedules. We should work with them to define how long we keep profiles, how we handle “right to be forgotten” requests, etc., in practice. There might be regulatory reporting that can be improved with CDP data (for example, if regulators ask for customer activity patterns, the CDP could help), so compliance might actually get value out of it too. It’s crucial to align with compliance on **governance processes**: e.g., any new data source added to CDP should be reviewed for compliance; any new marketing use of data should be vetted. By involving them from the start, we reduce the risk of having to re-engineer parts later due to compliance issues. Ultimately, compliance will likely sign off before the CDP goes live, so their concerns (security controls, consent enforcement, etc.) must be fully addressed in our scope.
- **Engineering/IT Team:** The engineering team (particularly those in platform, data engineering, and devops roles) will design, build, and maintain the CDP. This project will require cross-team collaboration: backend engineers to integrate systems, data engineers for pipelines, devops for infrastructure. It’s important to define **ownership**: likely a specific team (e.g. “Data Platform Team”) will own the CDP implementation. Engineering must ensure the system meets the scalability, reliability, and security requirements outlined. They will set up monitoring and be on call for any CDP-related incidents. Over time, maintenance tasks will include updating data schemas as the app evolves (e.g. if a new event type is introduced in the app, engineering needs to add it to CDP ingestion), managing system upgrades or vendor updates, and optimizing performance/cost. We should also plan for engineering support to the other teams – for example, helping marketing create a complex segment or troubleshooting why a certain data point looks off. Perhaps initially a weekly sync between engineering and marketing/data teams to address issues will help adoption. Another consideration: engineers must avoid disruption to current systems as we implement the CDP. We might phase the rollout (shadow run the CDP alongside existing processes until it’s validated) to ensure stability. Training internal developers on how to use the CDP’s APIs and data is also needed so they can build features that leverage it. This project has to be balanced with other engineering roadmap items, so we need buy-in from engineering leadership that CDP is a priority (which should be justified by the business value we expect). In summary, engineering’s role is both builder and long-term custodian of the CDP, requiring allocation of resources not just for the initial build but for ongoing operations.
- **Business/Leadership:** While not directly using the system, senior leadership (executives, heads of departments) are key stakeholders because they sponsor the project and expect certain outcomes. We need to keep them aligned by demonstrating how the CDP supports business objectives: increasing customer retention, improving lifetime value, reducing costs, gaining competitive edge via better user experience, etc. Leadership will be concerned with ROI – the cost of the project vs the benefits. We will define success metrics (for example, **increase in retention by X% in a year, or improved marketing campaign ROI by Y%**). Regular updates should be provided to them through the project to show progress (e.g. after Phase 1, we can now do A/B segmentation in days instead of weeks). They might also use high-level outputs from the CDP – like more accurate reporting on user metrics or financial forecasting improvements – to make strategic decisions. We should ensure the CDP’s reporting capabilities meet any needs leadership has for insights. Leadership will also want to know that data is governed well (to avoid scandals or breaches), so reassuring them about compliance steps is important. As stakeholders, their continued support might depend on quick wins, so we plan to deliver some use case results early (like a successful personalized campaign) to show the value. Their perspective is cross-functional alignment: the CDP project can serve as a rallying point for marketing, product, and engineering to collaborate closely, which leadership will appreciate as breaking silos (one of the goals of this initiative).

**Operational Ownership:** After implementation, we need a clear model for who “owns” the CDP operationally:
- We propose forming a **cross-functional CDP governance committee** or working group that includes representatives from product, marketing, data, engineering, and compliance. This group will meet periodically to review CDP usage, approve new data uses, and prioritize enhancements. This ensures alignment continues post-launch.
- Day-to-day, the **technical ownership** (maintenance, reliability) will reside with the Engineering/Data team (as mentioned, possibly a data platform team). They will handle infrastructure, updates, and integration of new sources. A **data steward** role can be assigned to ensure data quality and handle identity resolution tuning, etc.
- The **business ownership** in terms of driving use cases will lie with Marketing and Product teams. For example, the Marketing Ops lead might “own” the segment definitions and campaign configurations in the CDP, while the Product Growth manager owns the in-app personalization rules. They will use the tool the most and be accountable for leveraging it to hit team KPIs.
- **Support and Training:** We should designate who users contact for support. Likely the data team for any data accuracy issues, and maybe a marketing ops person for help with using the interface. We will produce documentation and run training workshops for all teams so they are comfortable using the CDP.
- **Maintenance Responsibilities:** include monitoring system health (engineers set this up), updating integration credentials (e.g. if an API key for MoEngage changes, who updates it in CDP), and reviewing segment effectiveness (marketing can sunset unused segments to reduce clutter, with data team help to archive their data). If using a vendor, part of maintenance is managing that vendor relationship (upgrades, account management).
- We will also plan for **continuous improvement**: the stakeholder group can gather feedback (maybe marketers want a new data attribute added, or product wants a new integration) and then engineering can schedule those improvements. This ensures the CDP evolves with our business.

By clarifying these stakeholder considerations, we aim for a smooth rollout and adoption. Every team knows how the CDP benefits them, what is expected from them, and how to collaborate around this new platform. This document itself serves to align everyone – giving context (why we do this), the solution plan, and their role in it – so that the CDP implementation is a joint success contributing to our peer-to-peer app’s growth and customer satisfaction.
