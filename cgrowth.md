# Career Growth Plan: Senior Product Lead ‚Üí Product Director (Fintech & Large Enterprise, London)

**Objective:** Elevate your role from Senior Product Lead to Product Director in 1‚Äì2 years by expanding leadership capacity, strategic impact, and industry presence. Below is a practical, step-by-step plan addressing the key areas requested, with suggested timelines and actions tailored to large organizations and fintech in the UK.

## 1. Leadership & Strategy Development üöÄ

**Goal:** Refine your leadership skills, strategic thinking, and understanding of governance to operate effectively at a director level in a big company.

- **Shift to Strategic Thinking:** Gradually transition from day-to-day product execution to a broader strategic role. Start by **carving out time each week for long-term planning** ‚Äì review market trends, competitor moves, and internal product strategy. Directors focus on product-line strategy and process **rather than individual features**, so practice thinking in terms of the entire product portfolio and business outcomes (e.g. resource allocation across products, not just your own ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=In%20my%20experience%2C%20PM%20Directors,settle%20disputes%20or%20demonstrate%20technique))„Äë. Within 3‚Äì6 months, aim to contribute to or lead a **product strategy offsite or roadmap planning session** for your division.  
  *üëâ *Why:* As a director, you‚Äôll be expected to ‚Äúworry about the **process of product management**...fostering cross-functional cooperation, standardizing reporting, and setting product-line-level strateg ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=In%20my%20experience%2C%20PM%20Directors,settle%20disputes%20or%20demonstrate%20technique))5„Äë. Demonstrating these skills now shows you‚Äôre ready to step up.

- **Enhance Decision-Making & Governance Knowledge:** In a large fintech enterprise, strong governance and strategic oversight are crucial. **Familiarize yourself with your company‚Äôs governance processes** (e.g. risk review boards, compliance approvals, portfolio management meetings). Volunteer to represent your product in these forums or join a steering committee within the next 6 months. This will expose you to **enterprise decision-making and regulatory considerations**. Many financial firms require robust product governance frameworks to ensure products **meet regulatory requirements and align with strategic objectives ([What is a Modern Product Governance Framework? And how to Create one.](https://www.skyjed.com/blog/what-is-a-product-governance-framework-with-templates#:~:text=A%20product%20governance%20framework%20is,management%2C%20compliance%2C%20and%20performance%20monitoring))9„Äë, so gaining experience here builds your credibility.  
  *üëâ *Action:* By month 6, schedule a meeting with a compliance or risk officer to better understand product approval processes. Apply that knowledge by **integrating compliance checkpoints** into your product strategy. This not only refines your strategic thinking (balancing innovation with regulation) but shows you can navigate governance in a fintech cont ([What is a Modern Product Governance Framework? And how to Create one.](https://www.skyjed.com/blog/what-is-a-product-governance-framework-with-templates#:~:text=In%20highly%20regulated%20industries%20such,growth%20while%20prioritising%20customer%20satisfaction)) ([What is a Modern Product Governance Framework? And how to Create one.](https://www.skyjed.com/blog/what-is-a-product-governance-framework-with-templates#:~:text=A%20product%20governance%20framework%20is,management%2C%20compliance%2C%20and%20performance%20monitoring))39„Äë.

- **Practice Executive-Level Communication:** Strengthen your ability to craft and communicate strategy. **Regularly present your product vision** and roadmap at broader team meetings or cross-department forums. Aim to **own a segment of an executive update or quarterly business review** within 6‚Äì9 months. Solicit feedback on your presentation style and clarity of thought. Focus on framing your message for a senior audience ‚Äì emphasize strategic choices, risks, and alignment with company goals, rather than feature details. This will prep you for the high-level discussions directors lead. Remember that a Product Director must confidently **present to executive leadership** and rally teams around a common vis ([The Product Manager Career Path: What does it look like?](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-career-path/#:~:text=A%20director,did%20as%20a%20sole%20contributor))58„Äë.  
  *üëâ *Milestone:* By the 1-year mark, you should be *the person* who can step in for your boss in leadership meetings when needed, effectively communicating product strategy to other execs. Being an **‚Äúadvocate for the product team to senior leadership‚Äù** is one of the two key tasks that transition a senior PM into a dire ([The Product Manager Career Path: What does it look like?](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-career-path/#:~:text=Senior%20product%20managers%20are%20well,product%20team%20to%20senior%20leadership))344„Äë, so use every opportunity to practice this.

- **Lead by Influence and Example:** Continue to **hone your people leadership skills** on a daily basis. This includes coaching team members, managing up, and demonstrating empathy and decisiveness. Solicit 360¬∞ feedback from peers and direct reports in the next quarter to identify any leadership blind spots. Large organizations value leaders who can **build consensus across the org** and improve team perform ([The Product Manager Career Path: What does it look like?](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-career-path/#:~:text=The%20Director%20of%20Product%20role,years%20of%20product%20management%20experience))362„Äë. For instance, if a project is faltering due to inter-team friction, step in to mediate and resolve issues ‚Äì *show* that you can ‚Äúkeep the trains running and the products flowing‚Äù as a good director  ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=process%20of%20product%20management%3A%20building,settle%20disputes%20or%20demonstrate%20technique))L87„Äë. Over 12‚Äì18 months, aim to have multiple examples where your leadership intervention steered a project or team to success. Each example becomes a story you can share in promotion discussions or interviews.

## 2. P&L and C-Level Exposure üíº

**Goal:** Gain hands-on experience with profit & loss considerations, and increase your exposure to C-suite decision-making.

- **Adopt a ‚ÄúProduct CEO‚Äù Mindset:** Begin running your product as if you own its **mini P&L**. Even if you don‚Äôt formally control a budget, start by tracking **business metrics** that drive profit or cost. Within the next 1‚Äì2 months, create a simple **Product Scorecard** covering metrics like revenue (or proxy KPIs such as user growth or subscription uptake), major costs, customer acquisition cost, support tickets, etc. This scorecard acts as a substitute P&L and shifts your focus to the **business of the product** rather than just delivery  ([How to Manage P&L as a Product Manager - Applied Frameworks](https://appliedframeworks.com/blog/how-to-manage-pl-as-a-product-manager#:~:text=Even%20if%20they%20don%E2%80%99t%20have,deliverable%20in%20a%20%2041)) ([How to Manage P&L as a Product Manager - Applied Frameworks](https://appliedframeworks.com/blog/how-to-manage-pl-as-a-product-manager#:~:text=A%20product%20scorecard%20is%20one,the%20business%20of%20the%20product))L184„Äë. Review it monthly with your manager or finance partner to identify trends.  
  *üëâ *Outcome:* By doing this, you demonstrate financial acumen. Even if only ~15% of product managers are directly accountable for P&L ([How to Manage P&L as a Product Manager - Applied Frameworks](https://appliedframeworks.com/blog/how-to-manage-pl-as-a-product-manager#:~:text=Decisions%20affecting%20profitability%20are%20often,were%20held%20accountable%20for%20P%26L))-L170„Äë, you‚Äôll stand out by proactively **tying product metrics to business goals** and speaking the language of executives (growth, revenue ([The Product Manager Career Path: What does it look like?](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-career-path/#:~:text=It%20would%20be%20best%20if,42%20create%20a%20production))-L257„Äë.

- **Build Financial Skills through Action:** Proactively seek out opportunities to **own budget-related tasks**. For example, volunteer to **write a business case** for an upcoming feature or new product proposal in your team (target this within 6 months). Research the market opportunity, model the potential revenue, and estimate costs ‚Äì essentially practice the motions of full P&L ownership. This is a critical skill for directors: fintech product leaders are often expected to ‚Äúbuild business cases for new product initiatives with a keen focus on market & opportunity s ([
        Product Director | FinTech | Open Banking    ](https://www.intelligentpeople.co.uk/job/product-director-ja9511-1713534184/#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Build%20a%20product%20management,size%20international%20opportunities%20for%20expansion))1-L88„Äë. By doing this now (even informally), you not only learn how to forecast and justify product investments, but you also signal to leadership that you can think like a GM.  
  *üëâ *Timeline:* Try to complete at least one substantial business case or ROI analysis by the end of year 1. If your current role doesn‚Äôt present a clear opportunity, create one ‚Äì for instance, identify a product improvement and craft a brief business case, then present it to your manager for feedback.

- **Get Comfortable with Profit/Loss Discussions:** In your current role, make friends with the Finance team and **participate in financial reviews** of your product (quarterly or annual planning). By mid-year, aim to be the person who can answer leadership‚Äôs questions on **product profitability, cost drivers, and revenue growth**. Even if ultimate P&L accountability resides with the CEO or GM in your org (common in large tec ([Profit and Loss Responsibility - Silicon Valley Product Group : Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/profit-and-loss-responsibility/#:~:text=In%20most%20companies%20today%2C%20the,up%20to%20the%20holistic%20product)) ([Profit and Loss Responsibility - Silicon Valley Product Group : Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/profit-and-loss-responsibility/#:~:text=In%20today%E2%80%99s%20model%2C%20many%20leaders,component%20of%20a%20larger%20product))81-L89„Äë), showing that you understand and *care* about these numbers sets you apart. Ask to be copied on financial reports or to join meetings where product financials are discussed ‚Äì even observing C-level discussions about P&L will build your confidence and insight.

- **Increase C-Level Visibility:** Deliberately **increase your exposure to executive stakeholders** over the next 6‚Äì12 months. Ways to do this include: presenting quarterly updates to the CPO or a senior VP, joining strategy meetings with executives, or informally sharing key wins/challenges with leadership via email. The goal is to get comfortable interacting with the C-suite and to **build a reputation as a strategic, business-savvy product leader**. By month 12, executives in your company should *know your name* and associate you with thoughtful insights. This is important because a director role will require you to regularly interface with VPs and even board-level stakeholders. In fact, **experience presenting to executive leadership** is explicitly cited as a prerequisite for director-level produc ([The Product Manager Career Path: What does it look like?](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-career-path/#:~:text=A%20director,did%20as%20a%20sole%20contributor))0-L358„Äë. If your company has skip-level meetings or a mentorship program with execs, take advantage of those to build relationships and learn how they think.

- **Influence Executive Decisions:** As you gain face time with execs, focus on **influencing their decision-making** in subtle ways. Come prepared with data-driven recommendations whenever you brief them. For example, if churn is rising, you might recommend a strategic pivot or a targeted retention investment ‚Äì and back it up with analysis. Over 12‚Äì18 months, strive to have at least one instance where your analysis or proposal influenced an executive decision (e.g. leadership green-lit a project you advocated, or adjusted strategy based on a trend you highlighted). These stories powerfully demonstrate that you‚Äôre operating at a director caliber. They also give you talking points to use in promotion conversations: you can point to how you didn‚Äôt just execute the roadmap, but actually **shaped the direction of the business**.

## 3. Horizontal Impact & Cross-Functional Influence ü§ù

**Goal:** Expand your impact beyond your immediate product team ‚Äì drive cross-functional initiatives and demonstrate influence at the enterprise level.

- **Take on Cross-Functional Projects:** Within the next quarter, identify a significant cross-team challenge or initiative and **volunteer to lead it**. It could be a **task force** to improve customer onboarding involving Product, Engineering, Marketing, and Operations, or a cross-department effort to evaluate a new fintech tool. It might be extra work, but this is exactly how you prove you can operate beyond your silo. As product management thought-leader Rich Mironov quips, *‚ÄúYuck? That‚Äôs how directors get things done.‚Äù* By taking on cross-functional projects, you not only free your own director from one more committee, you also **boost your visibility** across the orga ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=positioning.%20,show%20that%20you%E2%80%99re%20management%20material))19-L126„Äë.  
  *üëâ *Action:* Aim to initiate or lead 1‚Äì2 such cross-functional efforts in the next 6‚Äì9 months. Treat it as a development project for yourself ‚Äì set objectives, manage the diverse stakeholders, and deliver results. Afterward, gather feedback from those stakeholders about your leadership. Success here will show that you can **‚Äúdismantle organizational roadblocks‚Äù and align teams**, a key part of a direc ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=In%20my%20experience%2C%20PM%20Directors,settle%20disputes%20or%20demonstrate%20technique))‚Ä†L77-L85„Äë.

- **Broaden Your Perspective:** Start thinking beyond your single product: how do all the pieces of the business fit together? Over the next 6 months, make it a habit to **consider impacts on other products and departments** when making decisions. For example, if you run a B2C fintech app, how do your features impact the Operations support load or the Compliance team‚Äôs processes? Proactively reach out to peers in other product lines to understand their challenges. Look for chances to support *their* initiatives (perhaps your feature could unlock a new use case for another team‚Äôs product). By **advocating for another PM‚Äôs product or up-leveling a competitive analysis from a feature view to a market perspective**, you practice operating at a product line or portfo ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=%2A%20Find%20a%20product,committee%20and%20boosting%20your%20visibility))114-L122„Äë.  
  *üëâ *Step:* In the next 4‚Äì6 months, identify one product-line-level issue (e.g. inconsistent user experience across products, or an overlapping roadmap opportunity) and work with another product manager to address it. This shows you can **align multiple teams towards a common goal**, a necessity for enterprise product directors.

- **Develop Strong Stakeholder Relationships:** As a senior lead, you likely already work with Design, Engineering, etc. Now actively deepen those relationships and expand to new ones: **Sales, Customer Success, Legal/Compliance, and Finance** are all critical in fintech and big companies. Make it a goal in the next month to have one-on-one coffees or virtual meetups with leads from each key function to understand their goals and pain points. Continue this periodically (e.g. a coffee chat with a different dept head each month). By doing this, you‚Äôll start to see the business from multiple angles and can act as a **bridge between teams**. When you understand each function‚Äôs perspective, you can find ways to **align them with your product vision** ‚Äì which is the essence of effective cross-functional  ([Deep-Dive: Enterprise Product Management - Product Collective | Organizers of INDUSTRY: The Product Conference](https://productcollective.com/enterprise-product-management/#:~:text=Effective%20cross,great%20ones%20when%20done%20well))L378-L382„Äë.  
  *üëâ *Sign of success:* When **‚Äúother departments ask to work with you‚Äù** on their  ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=You%E2%80%99re%20a%20promotional%20candidate%20if,ask%20to%20work%20with%20you))15‚Ä†L63-L70„Äë, you‚Äôve achieved a key marker of horizontal influence. Strive to become known as the *go-to* product person for cross-team collaboration. For instance, if Marketing has a new campaign idea, they consult you for product implications; if Compliance is drafting new guidelines, they loop you in early. This reputation as a **collaborative influencer** will set you apart as someone ready to lead at a higher level.

- **Drive Cross-Functional Results:** Over the course of the year, aim to **deliver at least one high-impact outcome that required cross-team effort**. It‚Äôs not enough to convene meetings; directors are expected to *execute* and bring initiatives to fruition despite complexity. Perhaps you spearhead an integration of a new payments API that requires work from Security, Legal, and Engineering ‚Äì and it results in a new revenue stream. Or you coordinate a company-wide ‚ÄúFintech Innovation Day‚Äù hackathon that surfaces valuable project ideas and improves inter-team camaraderie. By the 1-year mark, have a story (or two) of a cross-functional win where you can clearly articulate: **here was the challenge spanning multiple teams, here‚Äôs how I led the collaboration, and here‚Äôs the outcome (with metrics)**. These examples will be gold in demonstrating ‚Äúenterprise-level influence‚Äù on your CV and in promotion discussions.

- **Be the Consensus-Builder:** In large organizations, aligning stakeholders is an art. Practice active listening and negotiation to resolve conflicts between departments. For example, if Sales wants a quick custom feature that Engineering resists due to technical debt, step in to **find a strategic compromise**. Perhaps you negotiate a solution where you build a lightweight version now but also schedule refactoring. Showing that you can **‚Äúcoax cooperation, align incentives, and cool down egos‚Äù** among various teams is demonstrating real director-le ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=Directors%20also%20focus%20on%20people,understanding%20of%20what%20PM%20does))15‚Ä†L85-L93„Äë. Over the next 12 months, purposefully put yourself in positions to mediate or facilitate tough cross-team discussions. You might not love conflict, but handling it well will prove your leadership mettle at the enterprise scale.

## 4. Mentorship & Networking üåê

**Goal:** Build a strong industry presence, leverage mentorship (both giving and receiving), and position yourself for director opportunities through a robust network.

- **Find a Mentor, Be a Mentor:** **Within 1‚Äì2 months, secure a mentor** who is operating at the Product Director or Head-of-Product level (either inside your company or in the London fintech scene). This could be arranged through formal programs or by simply reaching out on LinkedIn/at events. A good mentor will provide guidance on **navigating organizational dynamics, strategic thinking, and executive presence** ‚Äì essentially giving you a shortcut to lessons they learned the hard way. Regularly (e.g. monthly) discuss your progress and challenges with your mentor. *In parallel*, **start mentoring a junior product manager or associate** in your  ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=%2A%20Identify%20your%20best%20non,show%20that%20you%E2%80%99re%20management%20material))7‚Ä†L123-L126„Äë. Set up bi-weekly or monthly sessions to coach them on product skills or career growth. This has dual benefits: it hones your leadership and coaching abilities, and it signals to others (and to yourself) that you‚Äôre already operating as a leader of people. *Mentorship cultivates leadership skills* by forcing you to articulate decisions and guide others ‚Äì which improves team management and strategic decision-ma ([The Role of Mentorship in Product Management Career Development](https://www.productleadership.com/the-role-of-mentorship-in-product-management-career-development/#:~:text=match%20at%20L122%20,always%20lead%20to%20professional%20development)). It‚Äôs often said that *the best way to learn is to teach*, and mentoring is exactly that.  
  *üëâ *Milestone:* After 6 months of mentoring, ask your mentee (or their manager) for feedback on your effectiveness. Also check in with your own mentor on how you‚Äôve grown. You should start noticing that mentorship ‚Äúbridges the gap between theory and practice‚Äù for you, giving you real-world insights and acceleratin ([The Role of Mentorship in Product Management Career Development](https://www.productleadership.com/the-role-of-mentorship-in-product-management-career-development/#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20,exposure%20to%20industry%20best%20practices))h.

- **Engage in the Product & Fintech Community:** Begin actively **networking within industry circles** to raise your profile. A practical step is to attend at least one event or meetup **each month** in London‚Äôs tech or fintech scene. For example, **ProductTank London** is a popular monthly meetup where product professionals exchange ideas an ([ProductTank London | Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/producttank/#:~:text=ProductTank%20provides%20an%20opportunity%20for,things%20that%20get%20us%20excited))s. London also hosts many fintech events (FinTech Week, Innovate Finance Global Summit, etc.) ‚Äì mark your calendar for a few key conferences or meetups in the next year. Networking is not just about job hunting; it‚Äôs about learning and becoming visible. When attending, don‚Äôt just be a passive listener ‚Äì introduce yourself to speakers, ask questions, share your own experiences. Over 12‚Äì18 months, aim to become a familiar face in the local product management community.  
  *üëâ *Pro tip:* Set a goal to **speak at least once** in the next year at an event or on a panel. It could be a lightning talk at ProductTank or a webinar/podcast guest spot. This will significantly boost your industry presence. When you speak on a topic (say, ‚ÄúScaling Product in a Regulated Environment‚Äù or ‚ÄúLessons from Building XYZ at [Your Company]‚Äù), you establish yourself as a thought leader. Not only will you refine your own narrative and expertise, but you might catch the attention of recruiters or executives in the audience who are looking for product leaders.

- **Leverage Online Presence:** In today‚Äôs world, building a **personal brand online** complements in-person networking. Over the next 6 months, optimize your LinkedIn profile to reflect your professional story and aspirations. Write a concise summary that positions you as an emerging product leader with fintech and enterprise experience. Start sharing content (at least 1‚Äì2 posts a month): e.g. your take on a fintech trend, a book you read on leadership, or a proud team achievement (while respecting confidentiality). This consistent activity keeps you on the radar of your network. Additionally, consider writing a longer-form article on **Medium or LinkedIn** about a relevant topic (‚ÄúHow to Drive Innovation in Big Banks‚Äù or ‚ÄúProduct Management in Fintech: 3 Lessons from the Trenches‚Äù). Well-crafted content can be shared widely, further establishing your credibility. Over a year, these efforts accumulate ‚Äì by the time you‚Äôre applying/interviewing for director roles, it‚Äôs likely that hiring managers who google you will find a **rich, professional presence** that reinforces your expertise.

- **Network Strategically in Fintech:** Given your interest in fintech, consider joining **specialized groups or forums**. In the UK, communities like **Innovate Finance** (a fintech industry body) host networking events, and there are Slack/online groups for fintech product managers. Joining these can connect you with peers at other companies (Monzo, Revolut, legacy banks, etc.), and you‚Äôll hear about unpublicized job opportunities or insider insights. Make it a goal to **set up informational chats** with product leaders at 2‚Äì3 fintech companies you admire over the next year. These low-key conversations (you can frame it as wanting to exchange knowledge or learn about their product challenges) can open doors. When people know you‚Äôre talented and looking, they might refer you when a director spot opens up.

- **Build a Strong Reputation Internally and Externally:** Mentorship and networking go hand in hand in one aspect: *word of mouth*. Ensure that colleagues and industry contacts know about your successes and strengths. This is not about bragging, but about **sharing your wins and impact**. For instance, if your team hit a major milestone, celebrate it on LinkedIn and credit the team. Internally, if you mentor junior staff, their growth and praise will reflect well on you. If you help a peer in another department solve a problem, they might mention it to others. Over 1‚Äì2 years, these little reputation builders accumulate. By the time you formally pursue a director position, you‚Äôll ideally have **supporters or references** both inside your current firm and in the wider industry who can vouch for you.

## 5. Targeted Learning & Certifications üéì

**Goal:** Accelerate your transition with focused education ‚Äì courses, executive programs, and certifications that bolster your skill set for a product leadership role.

- **Invest in Executive Education:** Enroll in a **leadership or strategy course** aimed at rising executives. For example, **London Business School (LBS)** offers short executive programs and longer certificate courses that can be done while working. These programs are designed for experienced managers stepping into senior leadership, focusing on **business strategy, strategic leadership, and key comm ([London Business School Senior Executive Programmes in Leadership - Emeritus Online Courses](https://emeritus.org/online-certificate-courses/london-business-school-senior-executive-leadership-programs/#:~:text=Elevate%20your%20leadership%20journey%20with,and%20company%20and%20competitor%20performance))s**. By participating (target start within the next 12 months), you‚Äôll gain structured learning in areas like strategy development, financial acumen, and organizational leadership. Moreover, you‚Äôll **expand your network** by interacting with other ambitious leaders from various industries. LBS, Oxford Sa√Ød, or Imperial College all have reputable programs in London. Pick one that fits your schedule (some are a few weeks, some modular over months) and aligns with your growth areas.  
  *üéØ *Suggested Timeline:* Research and choose a program in the next 3 months (many have application deadlines). Aim to **complete an executive course by end of year 1** of this plan so that you can start applying the lessons (and adding the credential to your CV) before you hit the 2-year mark.

- **Deepen Fintech Domain Knowledge:** As you target fintech leadership, it‚Äôs valuable to formalize your understanding of finance and emerging technologies. A highly regarded option is the **Oxford Fintech Programme** (online, 7-week) which provides a **strategic overview of fintech innovations (blockchain, AI, open banking, etc.) and their busines ([Oxford Fintech Programme | Sa√Ød Business School](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/executive-education/online-programmes/oxford-fintech-programme#:~:text=The%20Oxford%20Fintech%20Programme%20equips,their%20own%20organisation%20or%20sector))**. This program, or similar fintech courses (e.g. Imperial College‚Äôs fintech certifications, CFTE‚Äôs Fintech Product Manager course), can equip you with up-to-date insights and vocabulary that fintech executives use. Consider enrolling in one within the next year ‚Äì it demonstrates commitment to the industry and arms you with ideas to bring back to your job.  
  *üëâ *Outcome:* By completing such a course, you should be able to confidently discuss how trends like DeFi or digital banking regulations might affect your product strategy. You can then take a lead in incorporating those insights at work (instant brownie points as someone who ‚Äúgets‚Äù the fintech space deeply). Also, mentioning this certification in interviews or internal dialogs shows you blend **product management with fintech savvy**, a combo highly attractive in London‚Äôs fintech market.

- **Boost Your Financial & Analytical Skills:** If you come from a more technical or design-focused background, make sure to **round out your business and financial skills** through targeted learning. Consider short courses like *‚ÄúFinance for Non-Financial Managers‚Äù* or online modules on interpreting financial statements. Even a Coursera or LinkedIn Learning course on product strategy, pricing, or analytics could help. Set aside time in the next 6 months to complete at least one such course or certification. The aim is to ensure you can confidently handle discussions on revenue models, unit economics, budgeting, and KPI setting ‚Äì all bread and butter for a Product Director. You might also look into **product management specific training** such as Product Focus‚Äôs strategy workshops or Reforge‚Äôs advanced courses. For instance, **Reforge‚Äôs Product Leadership program** focuses on how to build and manage high-performance product teams and how to effectively **‚Äúmanage up/down/across‚Äù ([Product Leadership Program - Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/courses/product-leadership-od/details#:~:text=This%20program%20focuses%20on%20how,manage%20up%2Fdown%2Facross%2C%20and%20communicate))ization**, which maps exactly to the skills you want to polish. These programs can often be done in parallel with work (Reforge runs cohort-based online courses).  
  *üéØ *Personal Learning Plan:* Make a list of 2‚Äì3 competencies you want to strengthen (e.g. ‚Äúenterprise Agile process‚Äù, ‚Äúdata-driven storytelling‚Äù, ‚Äústrategic roadmap planning‚Äù). For each, find a resource: maybe a book, a course, or a workshop. For example, read *‚ÄúInspired‚Äù by Marty Cagan* for product strategy, or take a public speaking workshop for better executive presentations. Allocate one competency focus every quarter. By the end of 4 quarters, you‚Äôll have significantly upleveled your toolkit in targeted areas.

- **Pursue Relevant Certifications:** While experience is usually valued over certificates at senior levels, **having certain certifications can give you an edge or fill gaps**. In large enterprises practicing scaled agile frameworks, a certification like **SAFe¬Æ Product Owner/Product Manager (POPM)** can be quite beneficial. It signals that you understand how to operate in a **Lean enterprise at scale, with cross-team coordination** ‚Äì useful in a big company setting. The SAFe POPM certification is globally recognized and shows you have the agile leadership skills to be a ‚Äúmulti-team player‚Äù in large Agi ([Career Opportunities for SAFe POPM Certified Professionals](https://www.simpliaxis.com/resources/career-opportunities-for-safe-popm-certified-professionals#:~:text=,very%20relevant%20in%20Agile%20transformations))ions. If your current company uses SAFe or similar, aim to get SAFe POPM certified in the next 3‚Äì6 months (the training is typically a 2-3 day course followed by an exam). Additionally, consider certifications in analytics (if needed) or even a mini-MBA type program if you haven‚Äôt covered business fundamentals elsewhere. Keep in mind, however, not to overdo it ‚Äì choose certifications that genuinely strengthen your profile or confidence. A **Prince2 or PMP** could be overkill (since you‚Äôre not moving to project management), whereas a **‚ÄúProduct Leader‚Äù certification from Product School or AIPMM** could be useful if it comes with learning. Pick 1‚Äì2 that make the most sense and complete them within this 1‚Äì2 year period.  
  *üí° *Note:* When listing courses/certifications on your CV or LinkedIn, emphasize what you learned or achieved (e.g., ‚ÄúCompleted Oxford Fintech Programme ‚Äì gained advanced insight into open banking and digital currency trends‚Äù). This helps hiring managers see the value beyond the certificate name.

- **Stay Current with Industry Trends:** Beyond formal courses, treat **continuous self-learning** as part of your routine. Set up Google Alerts or subscribe to fintech newsletters (e.g., Fintech Futures, Sifted) to keep a pulse on the market. As a future director, you‚Äôll be expected to know not just your product, but what‚Äôs happening in the wider world. Perhaps start a small practice like a **‚Äúweekly briefing‚Äù**: every Friday, spend 30 minutes summarizing a few industry news items or new fintech innovations and think about how they might impact your product or strategy. You could even share these insights with your team, subtly stepping into a thought leadership role. This habit shows strategic curiosity and will pay off in interviews when you can talk about the industry context with ease.

## 6. Positioning for Internal & External Roles üèÜ

**Goal:** Prepare and position yourself for the Product Director role, both by pursuing an internal promotion and by readying yourself for the external job market in parallel.

- **Map Out Internal Promotion Path:** **Initiate a candid career conversation with your manager** (and possibly your manager‚Äôs manager) in the next 1‚Äì2 months. Express your ambition to become a Product Director and ask for thei ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=,advocate%20for%20another%20PM%E2%80%99s%20product))upport. This humble but clear approach ensures your boss is aware of your goals ‚Äì you want them as an ally, not an obstacle. In the conversation, seek feedback: *What skills or accomplishments do I need to demonstrate in the next year to be a strong candidate for Director?* This does a few things: (1) You might get very specific guidance (e.g. ‚Äúlead a successful cross-team launch‚Äù or ‚Äúimprove your executive presentation skills‚Äù) that you can then execute on; (2) You put the idea in their mind that you‚Äôre gunning for growth ‚Äì they may give you stretch assignments or involve you in higher-level discussions going forward. Many organizations don‚Äôt automatically promote unless they see a need or a vacancy, so you sometimes have to **create the narrative** that *‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready and eager to take on more.‚Äù* Enlist your boss in that narrative. If you have a good relationship, they can be your sponsor up the chain.  
  *üëâ *Follow-up:* After this talk, periodically (every few months) check in on your progress with your manager. Show them how you‚Äôve acted on their feedback (‚ÄúYou mentioned I should gain more ops experience ‚Äì since then I‚Äôve been collaborating with Customer Support weekly and even solved X issue, which was a great learning.‚Äù). This reinforces your case. Also, discreetly find out the **organizational timing**: Are there director openings expected? Is the company growing a new product line that might need a leader? Knowing this helps you time your push. If a **re-org** or new initiative is on the horizon, that‚Äôs often the moment when new leadership roles appear ‚Äì be ready to raise your hand.

- **Deliver ‚ÄúDirector-Level‚Äù Results:** Promotions (or hires) often happen when you‚Äôre **already performing at the next level**. Over the next 12‚Äì18 months, make sure you **rack up a track record of achievements that match Product Director expectations**. We‚Äôve outlined many in the sections above (cross-functional wins, strategy initiatives, mentoring others, etc.). Keep a **journal or log of these accomplishments**. Quantify them: e.g., ‚ÄúLed cross-department project reducing onboarding time by 30%,‚Äù ‚ÄúMentored 2 junior PMs, both promoted within a year,‚Äù ‚ÄúPresented product vision to 50+ executives, resulting in alignment on 3-year strategy.‚Äù These concrete achievements with numbers and scope will be the core of your case. Whenever a potential promotion discussion arises, you can clearly articulate how you‚Äôve gone beyond the scope of a Senior Product Lead and are already operating as a de facto Director. In essence, **demonstrate those next-level-up skills ([Moving Up To Director](https://www.mironov.com/director/#:~:text=Directors%20of%20Product%20Management%20wrestle,up%20skills))rtunity**. This not only convinces your current employer, but if you decide to look outside, it gives you strong ammunition for interviews.  
  *üìà *Tip:* Directors are expected to tie their teams‚Äô work to business success. So, focus your accomplishments on **business impact and leadership**, not just delivering features. It‚Äôs more impressive to say ‚ÄúDrove 15% revenue increase by launching X in new market‚Äù than ‚ÄúLaunched feature X‚Äù. Always connect the dots to value ‚Äì this mindset will show through in how you talk about your work. And as you compile these wins, **update your CV and LinkedIn continuously**; don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre actively job hunting to remember what you did.

- **Polish Your Executive Profile (CV/LinkedIn):** Whether for internal promotion dossiers or external applications, your **CV and LinkedIn profile** need to scream ‚ÄúProduct Leader.‚Äù Rework your CV to **highlight leadership, strategy, and impact**. For each role and accomplishment, use active leadership verbs (‚ÄúSpearheaded,‚Äù ‚ÄúDrove,‚Äù ‚ÄúMentored,‚Äù ‚ÄúInfluenced‚Äù) and **quantify results**. Provide figures wherever possible: e.g., ‚ÄúLed a team of 5 PMs to deliver a new fintech product, achieving ¬£XM in revenue within 12 months‚Äù or ‚ÄúImproved customer retention by 20% through strategic feature development.‚Äù Including such metrics demonstrates you deliver value in a * ([How to write a product manager CV in 10 steps (with example) | Indeed.com UK](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/cvs-cover-letters/product-manager-cv#:~:text=Including%20relevant%20data%20on%20your,of%20saying%20you%20were%20responsible))manner**. Also, tailor your summary or objective statement to the director role ‚Äì mention things like P&L responsibility, product strategy, team leadership. In the UK market, CVs for senior roles often start with a brief profile paragraph: use that to position yourself as an **enterprise-savvy product leader** with fintech expertise (‚ÄúSenior Product Leader with 14+ years experience delivering growth in fintech and large-scale tech, now targeting Product Director roles to drive strategy, innovation, and cross-functional teams to business success,‚Äù for example).  
  *üëâ *Check:* Compare your CV against Product Director job postings in London (look at keywords they use). Many director roles emphasize **stakeholder management, influencing skills, strategic roadmap ownership, and scaling products**. Ensure those phrases or their equivalents appear in your CV if you have done them. Also, remember to ‚Äúfocus on the big picture‚Äù in your CV ‚Äì at this level, emphasize big achievemen ([How to write a product manager CV in 10 steps (with example) | Indeed.com UK](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/cvs-cover-letters/product-manager-cv#:~:text=4,picture))ar duties. You might de-emphasize some hands-on skills (like specific UX tools or coding, unless relevant) in favor of leadership accomplishments.

- **External Job Market Positioning:** Begin **discreetly exploring external opportunities** around the 12-month mark (or earlier if internal prospects look dim). This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll leave for sure, but it‚Äôs wise to know your market value and have options. Update your LinkedIn settings to show you‚Äôre open to recruiters (you can do this privately). Reach out to a few **recruiters or executive search firms** that specialize in product roles or fintech leadership in London. Firms like Intelligent People, Mind the Product Jobs, or fintech-specialist recruiters (e.g., Harrington Starr fo ([Fintech Week London's Flagship Conference - Harrington Starr](https://www.harringtonstarr.com/resources/event/fintech-week-london-s-flagship-conference/#:~:text=Fintech%20Week%20London%27s%20Flagship%20Conference,2024%20at%20the%20ExCeL%20London))oduct roles) can be good contacts. Share that you‚Äôre looking to transition to a Director role in the next year or so ‚Äì they might keep you in mind for roles that fit. Also leverage your network: let trusted contacts know what you‚Äôre aiming for. Oftentimes, **Director roles are filled via referrals or headhunting** rather than just applications, so you want to be on those radars.

- **Interview Preparation:** As you anticipate external interviews (perhaps starting ~12‚Äì18 months in), start preparing stories and examples that align with the six areas in this plan. You will almost certainly be asked about **leadership experiences, dealing with conflict, making strategic decisions, influencing without authority, handling a product‚Äôs success/failure, and knowledge of fintech trends**. Draw upon the work you‚Äôve done over this year: e.g., ‚ÄúTell me about a time you led a cross-functional project‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôll have a great answer from section 3‚Äôs initiatives. ‚ÄúHow do you handle product strategy?‚Äù ‚Äì you can mention how you‚Äôve contributed to long-term roadmap planning and cite market analysis you did. Also be ready for a case or presentation round: many senior product interviews involve a take-home strategy brief or a presentation to a panel. By following this plan, you‚Äôll accumulate plenty of material to use. **Practice articulating your vision and accomplishments in a concise, executive manner**. Maybe use your mentor or a trusted colleague as a mock interviewer to get feedback. The more you position yourself as a *peer* to the interviewers (who might be VPs or CPOs), rather than just a candidate, the more they‚Äôll see you as a fit for a leadership role.

- **Patience and Timing:** Finally, recognize that moving into a Director role is a big career move ‚Äì timing can be as much about opportunity as it is about readiness. **Be patient but prepared**. It might happen in 8 months if the perfect role opens, or it might take the full 2 years. Keep executing on this plan and **stay flexible**. If your current company offers a promotion sooner and you feel prepared, great ‚Äì you might reach your goal internally faster than expected. If not, having built up your resume and network, you should be in a strong position to land an external role. The London fintech scene is thriving, and experienced produc ([Best Product Director Jobs in London 2025](https://builtinlondon.uk/jobs/product/search/product-director#:~:text=The%20Senior%20Director%2C%20Product%20Management,team%20of%20product%20managers%2C))re in demand. By demonstrating leadership, strategic acumen, enterprise influence, continuous learning, and savvy career management, you‚Äôll present a compelling case for any large enterprise or fintech to hire you as their next Product Director.

---

**Conclusion:** By following this tailored plan ‚Äì focusing on elevating your leadership and strategic impact, gaining P&L and executive exposure, broadening your influence across the organization, actively engaging in mentorship and networking, upskilling through targeted learning, and strategically positioning yourself ‚Äì you will be well on your way to securing a Product Director role in a large enterprise or fintech in London within the next 1‚Äì2 years. Keep tracking your progress every quarter, adjust as needed, and maintain your enthusiasm and curiosity. The combination of **internal growth and external visibility** will maximize your chances of success. Good luck on your journey to Product Director ‚Äì you‚Äôve got this! üöÄüíº
